# sunset-pi
Quick project I did using native Python and fswebcam to take pictures of sunsets. 
Python queries a RESTful weather api which returns data about when a sunset is expected to occur in my region (Phoenix). Have the Pi on top of my greenhouse and pointed westward capturing pictures of phoneix sunsets!
