# sunset-pi
Project I did using native Python and fswebcam to take pictures of sunsets. 
Python queries a RESTful weather api which returns data about when a sunset is expected to occur in my region (Phoenix). I have the Pi on top of my greenhouse and pointed westward capturing pictures of phoneix sunsets!

Initially I did this project with a knockoff PiCamera module, which simplified the coding a lot, but was taking pictures with a very pink tint. The updated webcam version, while still optically imperfect, does better!
